# Algorithms: A study in C++

A work in progress with the objective of implementing most of the general purpose data structures and algorithms in C++ for later reuse in real projects and also studying data structures and algorithms themselves.

## Implemented and tested structures until latest revision:
 * Node
 * Stack
 * Queue
 * List
 * KeyNode
 * BinSearchTree

## Untested structures:
 * AVLTree
 * PriorityQueue
 * BNode

## To-do list:
 * Heap
 * BTree
 * HashTable
 * Graph
 * RedBlackTree
 * Algorithms(sorting, search, mathematical, etc)
