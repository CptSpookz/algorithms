# Algorithms: A study in C++

A work in progress with the objective of implementing most of the general purpose data structures and algorithms in C++ for later reuse in real projects and also studying data structures and algorithms themselves.

## Implemented and tested structures until latest revision:
 * Stack
 * Queue
 * List
 * Binary Search Tree
 * AVL Tree
 
## Untested structures:
 * PriorityQueue

## To-do list:
 * Heap
 * B Tree
 * Hash Table
 * Graph
 * Red-Black Tree
 * Algorithms(sorting, search, mathematical, etc)
